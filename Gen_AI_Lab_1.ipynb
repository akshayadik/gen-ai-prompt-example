            "\n",
            "4. Real-World Connection (15 minutes)\n",
            "- Show students articles or videos on topics like climate change and food production, and discuss how photosynthesis plays a crucial role in these areas. Encourage students to think about how changes in the environment can impact photosynthesis and vice versa.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Conclusion (10 minutes)\n",
            "- Review key concepts of photosynthesis, including the role of light and carbon dioxide, and its importance in the real world. Ask students to reflect on what they have learned and how they can apply this knowledge to understand issues like climate change and food production.\n",
            "\n",
            "Formative Assessment Ideas:\n",
            "- Exit tickets with questions about the role of light and carbon dioxide in photosynthesis\n",
            "- Quizzes or Kahoot games on key concepts of photosynthesis\n",
            "- Group discussions where students explain the photosynthesis process to their peers\n",
            "\n",
            "By incorporating formative assessments and real-world connections, this lesson on photosynthesis will engage students in understanding the importance of this process in the world around them.\n"
